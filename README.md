# Library Services Model

This repository is for the Library Data Services Team to develop a services model for the library. The information is kept in three areas, Issues, Files, Wiki. The README here should serve as an overview and quick reference.

## Issues
The bulk of the information will be kept as Issues, that will also populate a [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/psu-libraries/library_services_model) board (pretty much like Trello). The issues will serve two purposes. First, it will be the primary source for developing the service model. Potential and current services will be listed as issues, using an Agile development model and be expected to be used by an implementation team. We will also use issues in the same repository to plan our own work. 

Please feel free to add issues with questions, suggestions, user stories etc. Its generally considered polite to not edit other peoples' issues or comments, but you may suggest edits in comments.

## Files

Supplemental files can be stored in traditional Git repository (i.e. the Committe Charge is there). 

You can drag and drop files you think may be of help or interest to the group. If you want to create a directory using drag and drop, I've found the easiest way is to create the directory in your desktop and drag that over. 

Also you might want to explore command line or Github Desktop. 

## Wiki
Additional instructions, documentation, meeting notes and agendas will be stored in the Wiki. 

The Wiki, as most things in Github are written in Markdown by default. Its pretty easy, and widely used. Some helpful links.

  * [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  * [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Feel free and edit and contribute to the wiki as you see fit. Also, if you are unsure about a contribution, creating an issue is a great way to get a discussion about it.
