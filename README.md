# Library Services

This repository is for the Library Data Services Team to develop a services model for the library. The information is kept in three areas, Issues, Files, Wiki. The README here should serve as an overview and quick reference.

## Issues
The bulk of the information will be kept as Issues, that will also populate a [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/psu-libraries/library_services_model) board (pretty much like Trello if you have used that). The issues will serve two purposes. First, it will be the primary source for developing the service model. fWe will also use issues in the same repository to plan our own work. 

### Developing the Library Services Model

We are using a Problem Scenario based approach to developing our services model involving several stages. Personas, Problems, Solutions, Solution Review and Implementation. This is essentially a modified Agile form of project management. In traditional Agile, the project team usually creates a backlog (list) of potential features often in the form of short user stories. The problem scenario approach focuses more on problems, which often can be complex, then provides one or more solutions. In the Agile development world, problems might often be called **epics** whereas the solutions would correspond more to **user stories**. 


#### Personas
The first stage is to develop Personas which we added to the [Personas](https://github.com/psu-libraries/personas) for general PSU Library use. The personas were developed based on a combination of past experience with researchers as it relates to data and interviews with researchers for the specific purpose of developing personas. While the personas are fictionalized to maintain privacy and also provide more generality, they are based on real people and interactions. 

#### Problems
Based on the personas we generate problems based on the personas. While most of the problems can be directly tied to one or more persona, in practice some problems are also generated from interactions that didn't map directly to a persona. In most cases the problem can still be linked to personas they might potentially fit. In each problem there is a **Relevant Personas** section that serves to provide this link.

To create a problem open an issue and desribe the issue using a persona as the source. Create a link in the problem. Describe the problem in as much detail as necessary. Add a **Relevant Personas** section when appropriate listing other personas where this problem might apply. It need not be exhaustive. The intent is to provide a context whereby we can market and assess the solutions.

#### Solutions
Solutions are proposed ways to address the problems. The solution need not initially be fully planned out, although at implementation there should be enough there to implement. Also, not all solutions need be implemented. The goal is to use them as ideas that may be inmplemented. The next section describes the process to start scoring potential solutions. In some cases a solution may be a significant project in its own that requires more in planning and documentation that a single solution issue can fit. 



Please feel free to add issues with questions, suggestions, user stories etc. Its generally considered polite to not edit other peoples' issues or comments, but you may suggest edits in comments.

There is a quick intro to issues at https://github.com/psu-libraries/library_data_services_model/wiki/Basic-Issues


## Files

Supplemental files can be stored in traditional Git repository (i.e. the Committe Charge is there). 

You can drag and drop files you think may be of help or interest to the group. If you want to create a directory using drag and drop, I've found the easiest way is to create the directory in your desktop and drag that over. 

Also you might want to explore command line or Github Desktop. 

## Wiki
Additional instructions, documentation, meeting notes and agendas will be stored in the Wiki. 

The Wiki, as most things in Github are written in Markdown by default. Its pretty easy, and widely used. Some helpful links.

  * [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  * [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Feel free and edit and contribute to the wiki as you see fit. Also, if you are unsure about a contribution, creating an issue is a great way to get a discussion about it.
