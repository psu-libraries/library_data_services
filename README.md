# Library Services Model

This repository is for the Library Data Services Team to develop a services model for the library. The information is kept in three areas, Issues, Files, Wiki. The README here should serve as an overview and quick reference.

## Issues
The bulk of the information will be kept as Issues, that will also populate a [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/psu-libraries/library_services_model) board (pretty much like Trello). The issues will serve two purposes. First, it will be the primary source for developing the service model. Potential and current services will be listed as issues, using an Agile development model and be expected to be used by an implementation team. We will also use issues in the same repository to plan our own work. 

## Files

Supplemental files can be stored in traditional Git repository (i.e. the Committe Charge is there). 

## Wiki
Additional instructions, documentation, meeting notes and agendas will be stored in the Wiki.
