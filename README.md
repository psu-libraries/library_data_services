# Library Services Model

This repository is for the Library Data Services Team to develop a services model for the library. The bulk of the information will be kept as Issues, that will also populate a <a href="https://waffle.io/psu-libraries/library_services_model" target="_blank">waffle.io</a> board (pretty much like Trello).[waffle.io](https://waffle.io/psu-libraries/library_services_model){:target="_blank"}
